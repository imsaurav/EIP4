Session 1 Assignment-
Convolution -  A combination or summation or overlap that has information about the last set of local information.


Filters/Kernels- A matrix that extracts features(edges/textures) from image by multiplying and summing up values from the image. (3*3 most of the time)


Epochs- Each cycle of going through a DNN.With each epoch, the nn becomes a little smarter hopefully with identification than it's last version.


1x1 Convolution - It is a channel multiplier/combiner/mixer.All DNN use this as it works using 9 times less features compared to 3*3 and gives almost same RF. It helps reducing the Z.


3x3 Convolution - The window of size 3 * 3 traverses and extracts valuable features (by finding max in case of maxpooling sampling strategy) and converts in to a single pixel that has information of 9 pixels it scanned.


Feature Maps - a matrix that stores information about one particular feature's location in the image. Let's say position of after extracting a vertical edge being stored on vertical feature map.


Activation Function- This function decides when the neuron should be turned on or off depending on a rule.


Receptive Field - It's a field/matrix of pixels we are looking at/perceiving currently to make some sense.
